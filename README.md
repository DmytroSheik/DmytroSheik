## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the playbook file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly redundant, in addition to restricting access to the network.
- A load balancer is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers. The off-loading function of a load balancer defends an organization against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Jump servers are installed in such a way that they are placed between a secure zone and a DMZ to provide transparent management on devices on the DMZ once we establish a session. The jump server acts as an audit for traffic and a single point where we can manage user accounts.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the log data and metrics from the operating system and from services running on the server.
- Filebeat monitors the log files or locations that you specify, collects log events, and forwards them either to Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing.
- Metricbeat takes the metrics and statistics that it collects and ships them to the output that you specify, such as Elasticsearch or Logstash.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| Elk Serv | Elk Host | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |
| Web-1    | Host     | 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| Web-2    | Host     | 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- 136.49.206.64

Machines within the network can only be accessed by Jump-Server(Jump Box machine).
- We use Jump Box machine to access other machines in the network.
- Jump-Server public IP: 40.118.188.46
	Private IP : 10.0.0.4 

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box |     No              | 136.49.206.64        |
| Web-1    |     No              | 10.0.0.4             |
| Web-2    |     No              | 10.0.0.4             |
| ELKServer|     No              | 10.0.0.4             |


### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because it eliminates chance of human error and can be used to maintain large number of machines.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- First is to install docker.io to create a container within the ELKvm.
- Next, Python3 is installed so that the vm has a way to run the Kibana/Elastic scripts for Metricbeat and Filebeat.
- Increase the virtual memory of the vm to 262,144bytes
- Download the docker_containter image for ELK stack: _sebp/elk:761_ and always start/restart on boot.
The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats

This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- Web-1 10.0.0.5
- Web-2 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeat
- Metricbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat helps generate and organize log files to send to Logstash and Elasticsearch for later viewing in Kibana. It can collect log files from specific files generated by Apache, for example.
- Metricbeat collects metrics and statistics related to the webservers which can then be easily viewed and analyzed in Kibana. It can track things like the CPU and Memory usage of docker containers.

### Using the Playbook

In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the playbook and it's configuration file to your /etc/ansible directory.
- Update the configuration file for the playbook to include the ELKvm IP address and set the user name and password.
- Update the playbook file to include a command to download the Beat file via `curl` and add the drop source/destination.
- Run the playbook, and navigate to http://<ELKvm IP Address>:5601/app/kibana/ dashboard to check that the installation worked as expected.
